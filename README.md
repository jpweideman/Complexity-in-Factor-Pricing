## Overview

The paper investigates the impact of model complexity on factor pricing models within the stochastic discount factor (SDF) framework. It builds on the findings of Didisheim et al. (2024) and explores the behavior of expected returns under different model specifications and complexities. The repository includes the code for generating theoretical graphs used in the paper.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, the following Python packages are required:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## Results

The findings demonstrate that the impact of complexity on expected returns is contingent on specific assumptions about the model's factors and covariance structures. The results challenge the notion that increased complexity always leads to higher expected returns.
